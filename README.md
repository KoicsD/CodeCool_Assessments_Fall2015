# Welcome to my CodeCool Assessment Tasks!

At [*CodeCool*](https://www.codecool.com/), *Mentors* sometimes give us some assessment tasks in order to allow both for us and themselves to get some feedback about our work.
This repository is a collection about the Assessment Tasks I have had to solve and the way I have solved them.
I usually have no problems with these tasks but sometimes...

This repository only contains the assessment tasks of Fall 2015, which consist of [*python*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) tasks.
You can find the tasks of Spring 2016 [here](https://github.com/KoicsD/CodeCool_Assessments_Spring2016).

Thank you for visiting my repository! :)
